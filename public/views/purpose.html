            <p>
                This web based application will aid in the abstraction of tasks and repeated jobs for any team in need.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once a user has been established in the database, they will have the ability to add other people from their team,
                along with the job that has been assigned to them
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the future, users will be able to actively change the task assigned to other users and more advanced security will be 
                implemented for the website

                This project was, and continues to be, a learning process from start to finish. Prior to 
                starting this, I had no experience with any of the tools used to make it (except for the html and css).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To build this project, I used Node JS, Express JS, SQLITE3, AngularJS, and Bootsrap. The website is a single page applicaiton (SPA), which means
                that all of the websites content is loaded on the initial get request called when the website url is loaded. This makes
                the site much faster than a traditional website which makes calls to various routes as needed.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This site has been very fun to build and I look forward to continuing to build upon it in the future!
